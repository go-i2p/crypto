// Package ed25519 provides Ed25519 digital signature functionality for I2P cryptographic operations.
// This package implements the Ed25519 signature algorithm as defined in RFC 8032, providing
// high-security digital signatures with small key sizes and fast verification.
// Note: Ed25519 is for signatures only - use curve25519 package for encryption operations.
