Release notes for: `crypto` Version `0.1.3`
==============================================

This release resolves a compilation issue introduced during late December due to a peculiar build environment.
This code was intended to analyze information in the NetDB for unusual patterns by identifying(in a granular way) keys which are invalid.
It is necessary to resolve other compilation issues in the go-i2p library stack.

Thanks to @Nick2k4L for pointing out the issue.
