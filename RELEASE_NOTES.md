Release notes for: `crypto` Version `0.1.4`
==============================================

This release adds preliminary, untested support for Argon2ID as a KeyDeriver.
It is unused in the rest of the `go-i2p` codebase at this time and should not affect anything.
Other than that, the library is unchanged.
